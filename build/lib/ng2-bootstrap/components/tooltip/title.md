Inspired by the excellent Tipsy jQuery plugin written by Jason Frame. Tooltips are an updated version, which donâ€™t rely on images, use CSS3 for animations, and much more.

Base specifications: [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) or [bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/tooltips/)
